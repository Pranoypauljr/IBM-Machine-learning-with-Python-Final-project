# IBM-Machine-learning-with-Python-Final-project
This is the final project which i did as a part of the certification course which i took in coursera
# Task Description
Build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:
1.KNN
2.Decision Tree
3.SVM
4.Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
1.Jaccard Index
2.F1-Score
3.Log Loss

# Note
During the peer evaluation process one my fellow course attendee suggested to choose k value in case of KNN algorithm as 8 but i didnt get the time to check it.If you find that value as more suitable please create an issue suggesting the same.CHEERS:)
